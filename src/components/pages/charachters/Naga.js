                has brought me here on a whim. Besides these guys bring a lot of opportunity to practice my skills without consequences. This is going to be so 
                much fun making coin and blasting any opposition with my power. </li>

                that could be unusual. Sorcerers can be quite troublesome though this one is still young enough to be dealt with easily if alone. Timing will be 
                important but only if deemed necesarry, hopefully this will become apparent soon before his strength grows.</li>
