                    Through inspirational songs or tales and a knack for having something for any situation Silvertone the group as a whole has become more 
                    dangerous. While his support of others makes them more deadly, alone he does not seem prticularly dangerous. His father finally got back 
                    to us and promised not to interfere, that his son was on his own. Still it is best not to over do it where a Barron's son is concerned.</li>
