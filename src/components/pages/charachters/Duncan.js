                     I'm not quite sure where he comes from all I know is that if you need something infiltrated or someone to give you dirty information
                     on someone he's the guy you'll want to talk to. But just make sure that you dont ask for anything about house Orien or house Lyrandar;
                     the strange bloke refuses to do anything that involves either of them. </li>
                    <li className="list-group-item"><strong>Official Report:</strong><br/>Assessed to be an excellent marksman Duncan has yet to reveal his skill set
                    or why the group hired him. Rumors are that Silvertone recomended him and considering his manner of handling business it's likely it involves
                    something underhanded.</li>
